During his time at Gaia House, Rob wrote Seeing that Frees: Meditations on Emptiness and Dependent Arising (seeingthatfrees.com) – an important and influential work that continues to shape and open the meditative exploration of many. Emerging from this deep experiential understanding of emptiness, Rob dedicated much of his time and energy during the last years of his life to conceiving, developing, and establishing a new body of teachings that he called ‘A Soulmaking Dharma’. Before his death, Rob initiated the Hermes Amara Foundation (HAF), an organisation that is working to preserve and develop Rob's vast Dharma teaching legacy, and to support practitioners and teachers who are engaged with these teachings. To join the HAF mailing list and find out more about Rob's work please go to hermesamara.org or get in touch at hermes.amara@gmail.com  Rob was also a guiding teacher of Freely Given Retreats (freelygivenretreats.org), a co-founder of Sanghaseva, an organisation exploring the Dharma through international service work (sanghaseva.org) and a co-initiator of DANCE, the Dharma Action Network for Climate Engagement (thedancewebsite.org).</description><language>en</language><copyright>Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-NoDerivative Works 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0</copyright><image><url>https://media.dharmaseed.org/uploads/photos/teacher_210_125_0.png</url><link>https://dharmaseed.org/feeds/teacher/210/</link><title>Dharma Seed - dharmaseed.org: Rob Burbea's most recent Dharma talks</title></image><lastBuildDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2020 09:30:00 +0000</lastBuildDate><atom:link href="https://dharmaseed.org/feeds/teacher/210/?max-entries=all" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"></atom:link><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:summary>ROB BURBEA (1965-2020) was Gaia House’s much-loved resident teacher for 10 years from 2005 - 2015, when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

Dharma talks, and interactive exercises, we will affirm our capacity to take part in the healing of our world.  Each of our lives is played against a backdrop of war-making, hunger, mass extinctions and increasing climate chaos. The Buddha's teachings show how we can respond to the suffering of our time in ways that bring courage, gladness, and deep community.

Our day together will draw on the Work That Reconnects, developed by Joanna over the last 35 years, and on Jennifer's soul-expanding music, that has empowered activists the world over.

Joanna Macy is known worldwide as a Gaian teacher whose trainings strengthen movements for global justice. Her books include &lt;i&gt;Dharma and Development, Coming Back To Life, Mutual Causality in Buddhist Teachings and Systems Theory,&lt;/i&gt; and her memoir &lt;i&gt;Widening Circles,&lt;/i&gt; as well as translations of Rilke's poetry.

Jennifer Berezan is a renowned singer/songwriter whose work is informed by Buddhist and indigenous teachings as well as her adventures at the forefront of social change.
